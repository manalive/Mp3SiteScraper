# Mp3SiteScraper
An application to download MP3s from a site for which we had a login but no API

To use this application: 

- rename or copy 'credentials-sample.py' to 'credentials.py' and populate credentials
- rename or copy 'settings-sample.py' to 'settings.py' and populate the base site url and storage path for downloaded files

Once running, a rudimentary web page will be available to allow some control over which files are downloaded.
